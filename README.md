# Classification of bank customers in terms of credit card churn

### About the report

I would like to invite you to read my report on the classification of bank customers in terms of credit card churn. Using [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anwarsan/credit-card-bank-churn/data?select=credit_card_churn.csv) from the Kaggle, I have prepared complete analysis and classification models for this problem.

### About the repository

The following items are available in the repository:
